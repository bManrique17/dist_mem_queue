The cats jumped over the lazy dogs.
Today is a beautiful day.
I love to travel and explore new places.
Happiness is a choice.
Music soothes the soul.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Time flies when you're having fun.
Life is a journey  not a destination.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow.
In the end  we only regret the chances we didn't take.
Strive not to be a success  but rather to be of value
Life is about making an impact  not making an income.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
Don't cry because it's over  smile because it happened.
Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success.
The only way to predict the future is to create it.
Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try.
It is never too late to be what you might have been.
The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
Dream big and dare to fail.
The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.
Success is not the absence of failure; it's the persistence through failure.
The biggest risk is not taking any risk.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
"You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think."
Everything you can imagine is real.
"Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, but learning to dance in the rain."
Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.
"Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life."
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
Your limitation들t's only your imagination.
What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.
"Happiness is not by chance, but by choice."
