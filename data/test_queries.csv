The cat jumped over the lazy dog.
Today is a beautiful day.
I love to travel and explore new places.
Happiness is a choice.
Music soothes the soul.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Time flies when you're having fun.
Life is a journey, not a destination.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow.
In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.
Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value
Life is about making an impact, not making an income.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.
